**Eldridaist Faith**

The Eldridaist faith is a monotheistic religion that reveres Kalee, the Great Mother. The faith emphasizes submission, obedience, and devotion to Kalee's teachings, which are believed to bring harmony and balance in all aspects of life.

**Founding:**

Saint Anna was born in Eldria on August 23, 1800, into a devoutly Christian family. However, she began questioning her faith and seeking answers that were more meaningful to her. In May 1820, Saint Anna had a vision from Kalee, which awakened her to a divine mission to spread the goddess's teachings.

With the support of Holy Queen Eldra, Saint Anna traveled extensively throughout Arkavia, establishing churches and spreading her message. The Eldridaist faith was officially recognized by royal decree on October 10, 1820, with King Atlas supporting the establishment of the faith.
